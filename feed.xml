                <h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>Aging is a natural process, but science shows that how we age can be influenced by certain choices and habits. One of the most exciting ideas in this area is called <i>hormesis</i>. This concept explains how a little bit of stress on the body—the right kind at the right dose—can actually make us healthier and help us live longer. Hormesis helps our bodies get stronger and better at protecting themselves, especially as we age.</p>
<h2><strong>What is Hormesis?</strong></h2>
<p>Hormesis is a biological phenomenon where low doses of a harmful agent or stressor produce beneficial effects. In simple terms, what doesn’t kill you can make you stronger—if the dose is low enough. This happens because the body reacts to small stress by activating repair and defense systems. These systems make our cells tougher and more efficient. For example, a little bit of heat, cold, or fasting stresses the body in a good way, triggering processes that help us stay healthy <span style="color: #0563c1;"><u><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20350594/">(1)</a></u></span>.</p>
<h2><strong>How Hormesis Helps Fight Aging</strong></h2>
<p>As we age, our cells become less efficient at repairing damage and dealing with stress. Hormesis works by stimulating protective mechanisms in our cells. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Antioxidant defense systems</strong>: Low-level stress can activate pathways like Nrf2, which increases the production of antioxidant enzymes that clean up harmful molecules called free radicals <span style="color: #0563c1;"><u><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22108204/">(2</a></u></span>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mitochondrial health</strong>: Mitochondria are the power plants of our cells. Mild stress can boost their function and even help make new mitochondria, improving energy and slowing aging <span style="color: #0563c1;"><u><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20350594/">(1) </a></u></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Autophagy</strong>: This is the process of cleaning out damaged cell parts. Hormesis triggers autophagy, keeping cells clean and working properly <span style="color: #0563c1;"><u><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25661524/">(3)</a></u></span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Natural Ways to Use Hormesis for Healthy Aging</strong></h2>
<p>Several natural habits use the principle of hormesis to improve our health. Here are some examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Intermittent Fasting and Caloric Restriction</strong>: Eating less or going for periods without food causes mild stress to the body. This activates repair pathways and improves insulin sensitivity, which may slow aging and prevent diseases <span style="color: #0563c1;"><u><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27304506/">(4)</a></u></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Physical activity puts the body under controlled stress. Regular moderate exercise increases our ability to handle oxidative stress and improves mitochondrial function, which helps us age better <span style="color: #0563c1;"><u><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18191751/">(5)</a></u></span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Heat and Cold Exposure</strong>: Going into a sauna or taking a cold shower can activate protective stress responses. Heat stimulates proteins that repair damaged cells, while cold improves fat metabolism and reduces inflammation <span style="color: #0563c1;"><u><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exger.2021.111509">(6)</a></u></span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Plant-Based Compounds (Phytochemicals)</strong>: Certain foods contain mild toxins that trigger the body’s defense systems. Examples include curcumin from turmeric, resveratrol from grapes, and sulforaphane from broccoli. These compounds stimulate antioxidant and detox pathways <span style="color: #0563c1;"><u><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18543123/">(7)</a></u></span>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Medications That Mimic Hormesis</strong></h2>
<p>Some drugs also work by creating small amounts of stress in the body, which can trigger protective processes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Metformin</strong>: Commonly used to treat diabetes, metformin causes a mild energy stress in cells. This activates AMPK, a key protein involved in longevity and metabolism <span style="color: #0563c1;"><u><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24889636/">(8)</a></u></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rapamycin</strong>: ​Rapamycin, a well-known inhibitor of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, exhibits hormetic properties that may contribute to its potential anti-aging effects <span style="color: #0563c1;"><u><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32684871/">(9)</a></u></span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2><strong>Supplements That Stimulate Hormesis</strong></h2>
<p>Some natural supplements can mimic hormetic stress and activate protective responses in the body:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Berberine</strong>: A plant compound found in herbs like Berberis, berberine induces mild oxidative stress and activates AMPK and Nrf2 pathways, leading to hormetic benefits <span style="color: #0563c1;"><u><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31973689/">(10)</a></u></span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quercetin</strong>: This flavonoid found in onions and apples has been proposed to have hormetic effects and induces a mild stress that boosts antioxidant enzyme levels and promotes cellular resilience<span style="color: #0563c1;"><u><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38142767/"> (11)</a></u></span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mild ozone therapy</strong> and <strong>low-dose radiation</strong> have also been proposed as non-conventional hormetic interventions, though these remain controversial and require more clinical evidence <span style="color: #0563c1;"><u><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21575276/">(12)</a></u></span> <span style="color: #0563c1;"><u><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38073286/">(13)</a></u></span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>The idea of hormesis gives us hope that we can age better by using smart, manageable amounts of stress to train our bodies to be stronger and more resilient. Simple habits like fasting, exercising, using saunas, and eating certain plants and can all help activate these healthy responses. Some medications, herbs and supplements may also provide similar benefits. As research continues, using hormesis may become a key part of how we prevent disease and live longer, healthier lives.</p>

                <p><strong>Introduction</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depression affects millions worldwide, presenting not only as persistent sadness but also as a mix of emotional, physical, and cognitive symptoms. While conventional treatments like medication and therapy are helpful, they don’t address the root causes for everyone. Functional medicine takes a different approach, looking at the interconnected systems in the body to find and treat the underlying imbalances contributing to depression.</span></p>
<p><strong>Functional Medicine and Root Causes</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Hormonal Imbalances</strong><strong> </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dysregulated cortisol, thyroid hormones, or sex hormones can influence mood and energy. For instance, hypothyroidism is often associated with depressive symptoms </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392461/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(1)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Adrenal dysfunction, which disrupts the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, can also exacerbate depression </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18675469/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(2)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Gut-Brain Axis</strong><strong> </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The connection between the gut and brain is undeniable. Research shows that an imbalance in gut microbiota (dysbiosis) can lead to increased inflammation and disruption of the gut-brain communication, significantly impacting mood </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22968153/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(3)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A study revealed that probiotics could reduce depressive symptoms by modulating the gut microbiome </span><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2020.00421/full"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(4</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Neurotransmitter Dysfunction</strong><strong> </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Functional medicine evaluates neurotransmitter health, such as serotonin, dopamine, and GABA. Studies show that deficiencies in amino acid precursors like tryptophan and nutrients like vitamin B6 and magnesium impair neurotransmitter function and supplementation and replenishment of these substances involved in neurotransmitter physiology can be a good option for a more optimal management of Depression </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12420702/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(5)</span></a> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16542786/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(6</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Chronic Inflammation and Oxidative Stress</strong><strong> </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elevated levels of inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokines, have been consistently linked to depression </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26711676/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(7)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Identifying the factors associated with inflammation provides the option of managing it through manipulating these factors and through diet and lifestyle interventions (</span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24228900/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">8)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Treatment Strategies in Functional Medicine</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Personalized Nutrition</strong><strong> </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Functional medicine practitioners often recommend anti-inflammatory diets like the Mediterranean diet. This diet has been linked to reduced depression rates due to its high levels of omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and phytonutrients </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30591059/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(9)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Supplementation</strong><strong> </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Targeted supplements, such as omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D, have been shown to improve mood and overall brain health </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23377209/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(10)</span></a> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21939614/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(11)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Sublette et al., 2011; Anglin et al., 2013). Magnesium supplementation has also been found to alleviate symptoms of major depression </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16542786/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(6</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Lifestyle Interventions</strong><strong> </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lifestyle factors like stress management, regular exercise, and mindfulness practices can significantly impact mental health. Exercise has been proven to increase endorphin levels and reduce inflammation (</span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29150166/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">12</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Advanced Testing</strong><strong> </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Functional medicine practitioners use advanced testing to assess deficiencies, hormone levels, and gut health. This personalized approach ensures targeted treatments for optimal outcomes.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><strong> </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depression is a complex condition that often requires a multifaceted approach. Functional medicine emphasizes addressing the root causes rather than just alleviating symptoms. Through personalized nutrition, targeted supplementation, and lifestyle changes, this approach offers hope to those struggling with depression.</span></p>

                <p>Mitochondria, that ubiquitous energy powerhouse of our cells are gaining more and more importance!</p>
<p>This where all the energy is produced to power our brain cells. So, as we age, their power to provide sufficient energy to power the brain also wanes. A recent article in "New Scientist" states that per the "grand unified theory" of neurodegeneration, decreased function of these energy houses may be behind cognitive decline, especially in those various neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's to name a few.</p>
<p>So it makes sense to use strategies increase the health and recharge these energy producing organelles.</p>
<p>What are some of these strategies to do this? Actually, some of them are quite simple, like exercise (that quintessential golden bullet!)</p>
<p>Exercise stimulates mitochondria and reduces neurodegeneration.</p>
<p>Dietary changes, certain foods, and some nutritional supplements can help recharge and replace old mitochondria to provide better energy production, better cognitive function, and healthier ageing. See your naturopath to learn more about these healthy ageing measures can help you age gracefully, and keep your brain healthy</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all want a happy healthy life, but we all wonder at times if this is really possible? Especially at times when we are experiencing pain (&amp; suffering)! Is pain inevitable? Can we not do something about it? Yes, we can! We can do lots to prevent and treat pain. We have multiple options available. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pain is a universal phenomenon. As are analgesics. By taking a Tylenol, we may get rid of the pain for a while, but to tackle it for the long term, and to understand and really deal with where it is coming from, we need to go deeper. Pain occurs and is sensed and influenced at different levels, and needs to be tackled accordingly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are different elements which may be influencing and causing pain and increasing our perception of it. We need to get to the root cause of these, than to just keep suppressing pain with an analgesic without tackling the real culprits behind it. Pain can be the result of different dysfunctions and diseases and these have to be figured out and dealt with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimal Nutrition and Diet are important components to strengthen our body and reduce occurrence and perception of pain. Herbals and supplements can help us deal with pain. Acupuncture is another modality at our disposal where we can approach pain and its etiology through a different prism of Chinese medicine and the energy meridians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gut and the microbiome are two elements, dysfunction of which can be at the bottom of an inflammatory response which may be contributing and can be tackled relatively easily with some diligence towards strategies aimed at achieving a healthy balance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then again, our brain and stress responses can affect both the occurrence of pain as well as our perception of it. And there are many strategies we can employ to achieve an optimal state of mind here through simple techniques like some deep breathing exercises and mindfulness techniques. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our attitude matters too! Practicing an attitude of gratefulness and compassion can lead our mind into a more receptive mode to the universal positive forces. This in turn will help foster a feeling of acceptance and ability to change, which will alter our perception of pain as well as reduce our stress response which contributes to augment pain. From here we can move forward to a feeling of more ownership, more confidence, and more control. We can then perceive and bring about positive changes not just for the pain (and suffering) but for our life in general (and for the lives of those around us). Counseling and CBT are some approaches which can help propel us towards these positive changes</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Physical actions can also cause and relieve pain. Regular exercise acts on at least two levels, one through release of endorphins in  the brain , then through  enabling a healthy immunity, and through creating a stronger system in terms of the physical body better able to tackle pain. Strengthening the physical elements may be all that is needed and that maybe all that is the root cause of pain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So start your journey to a better, happier life and tackle your pain. A naturopath who will take a comprehensive intake over a 1-11/2 hour period maybe best suited to sit down with you to help you get to the root cause of your pain. And the earlier it is tackled the better to prevent progression and to allow you to get back into the flow of your life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here's to a happier pain free flow of life for all of us. May the positive force be with you!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, we are not talking about gut feelings or instincts today (though we might delve into that at some point too!). We are talking about your gut health and any symptoms of an imbalance or gut dysfunction. This is an important topic because you ignore these symptoms at your own peril:)! After all, you are what you imbibe, and what are you imbibing more than the food and liquid through your gut? (apart from the intangibles through your other senses, which as we previously made clear is a matter for another day:).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, not to stray from the topic at hand, what I am trying to emphasize here is the importance of the diet you take, and how you take it. And likely your gut will understand first whether you are feeding it properly or not, and will communicate that with you through some symptoms, possibly digestive issues. This is your gut telling you to make some changes. Soon. For starters, it wants you to reduce the processed foods and artificial sugars in your diet! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When God or The Higher Power (or Evolution) made you, they also made for you natural sources of nourishment and relied on you to imbibe these natural foods for which they prepared your body's digestive systems. They did not prepare your body to deal with some fancy chemicals with un-pronouncable names and did not expect you to imbibe them and put your gut and body in complete confusion! So ditch these now and take some healthy foods and fibers instead, and if needed have your gut looked at by a naturopath to assist in healing it from the damage that has ensued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When such insults to your gut are perpetrated and its protesting symptoms ignored, that will also likely go on to influence your energy, your hormones, your inflammatory and immune components if allowed to proceed further. So do yourself a favor and don't ignore these symptoms. If you are having symptoms of heaviness, or reflux, or cough or brain fog after eating, or IBS (a topic in itself for another day), or constipation or recurrent diarrhea, it is good to get some support sooner than later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To learn more on how to optimize your diet and nutrition, and to address your digestive symptoms before things proceed further, do indulge in some self care and book an appointment with your friendly neighborhood naturopath or functional medicine practitioner, for some comprehensive holistic care to get back your happy worry free gut feeling and life back!</span></p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent study done to assess the quality of care received by patients with depression and anxiety seen by naturopathic physicians in a community health center found overall improvement in symptoms of depression and anxiety was highly significant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturopathy by the very virtue of the basic fact that it takes a holistic view of the person, including looking at their mental and emotional states in addition to physical ones, is aptly suited to support treatment of conditions like depression and anxiety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the fact that simple nutrient deficiencies and poor dietary choices, lack of exercise, can lead to and exacerbate these conditions, and that these are the cornerstones of any naturopathic evaluation and treatments, again make naturopathy aptly suited to help people going through these conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not everyone who’s sad is depressed! Depression is said to occur when it is inappropriate and out of proportion to a precipitating factor or occurs without one. It can range from mild to moderate to severe, can be seasonal or not, can be due to various contributing factors like environmental, work and stressful situations, genetic, nutrient deficiencies, vitamin deficiencies like Vitamin D and B12, lack of emotional support, lack of exercise, and lack of sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturopathy takes a look at all these factors, rules out and treats deficiencies, and then along with therapy and counseling, provides various nutritional supplement and herbal options, which generally have much less side effects and even comparable efficacy as in the case of St John’s Wort, to name one, with much less side effects to conventionally prescribed antidepressants like SSRIs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amino acid supplements like 5 HTP, L threonine, glycine are the  building blocks of neurotransmitters like serotonin and GABA, which can help. Omega 3 supplements have a large role as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Botanicals like passionflower, valerian, saffron , and of course SJW can help. These should however be taken under naturopathic supervision to avoid side effects like photosensitivity and numerous drug reactions in case of SJW.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depression has a large worldwide incidence, and progression in severity can lead to the risk of suicide and catatonic behaviour. So don’t delay treatment, and contact a naturopathic doctor for a comprehensive holistic evaluation and safer and supportive treatment options.</span></p>

                    <p><img src="https://aaravtuteja2.github.io/omniheal/media/posts/1/Omni-Heal2.jpeg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <p> </p>
<p>Joint pains and joint swelling are not a pleasant sensation to have, to say the least. The causes can be varied, the presentation can be varied, it could be an osteoarthritis or it could be a rheumatoid arthritis, it could have appeared seemingly suddenly, or it could be an insidious onset.</p>
<p>Osteoarthritis is more of a wear and tear with some inflammation, whereas Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune response. Lupus is another autoimmune affliction, as is also psoriatic arthritis, which can cause joint issues too. Rheumatoid Arthritis usually attacks the small joints in your hands and feet whereas Osteoarthritis more likely affects more the weight-bearing joints like hips and knees. Treatment options depend on the type of arthritis as well. Mainstays of treatment are usually anti-inflammatories and analgesics, locally applied or systemic.</p>
<p>Physiotherapy and exercise are usually of immense help. What we fail to take into cognizance, however, are some root underlying causes. Increasing evidence is emerging on the association of conditions like leaky gut syndrome[1], or a disruption in the gut microbiome[2], and consequent inflammatory increases with joint symptom exacerbations, and of of consequent autoimmune responses leading to conditions like Rheumatoid arthritis, which may in some cases emerge into awareness post a stomach flu like infection, some of the causative organisms of which have been linked to autoimmunity.</p>
<p>So apart from just treating them symptomatically, it would make sense to also look for and address these underlying conditions, and cases with consequent relief to these measures attest to their role, apart from also improving your general well-being.</p>
<p>A multi-pronged approach is usually taken tailored to your unique situation after a full comprehensive consult. This could aim to heal your gut if needed to control inflammation and also modulate your immune system. Appropriate treatment modalities are used for this with dietary changes where necessary, nutritional supplements, and vitamins and mineral supplementation as required. Anti inflammatory foods and supplements as well as herbal products can be very helpful. A holistic treatment plan is built in consultation for initial treatment and future maintenance. This approach attempts to address root causes as well as symptoms, rather than just a treatment and suppression of symptoms. Acupuncture and exercise are useful. The sooner these causes are addressed the better, as with progression, damage will keep increasing.</p>
<p>So if you do have these joint pains and swellings, do see a naturopath or functional medicine practitioner sooner rather than later to see if something that could possibly improve your well being and give you significant relief in these conditions is being missed.</p>
